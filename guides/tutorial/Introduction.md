# Welcome 

The tutorial is desinged to demonstrate the features available in Fibril. It doesn't try and document every single feature or setting but is designed to wet your appetitate as they say. Ok, lets dive in...

Actually, before we do dive in, I'd like to thank the Filament team for their aweseome work that has inspired both Fibril and this tutorial.

# The Demo Application

The demo application we will be building is a system to manage a vet's practise. We'll be able to create Owners and thei Pets and add treatment for a Pet. Finally we'll have a dashboard showing some key metrics about the practise. Nothing too fancy but hopeully enough to demonstrate the kind of things you can accomplish with Fibril.

# What you need to know

The demo assumes you have a basic knowledge of Phoenix and are comfortable creating projects, resources and changesets.
