1. [DONE] Do we really need to specify layout - should we just use what is in the library?
2. [DONE] Getting data for a field (in the index view) needs to cater for 4 scenarios:
    1. A simple atom e.g. :name, :date_of_birth
    2. A list [:owner, :name] generally used for associations
    3. A map with a key of name: the value of which is an atom
    4. A map with a key of name: the value of which is a list

3. [TODO] Allow prefix for resource configuration to be changed via a config option.
4. [TODO] Allow specification at application or resource level using layout: {foo, :blah} - maybe call a help function to 
return it.
5. [DONE] Can we remove verified routes?
6. [DONE] Allow configuration of url to access resources (but default to /admin)
7. [TODO] Review use of resource name and plural to assure we are using them correctly (especially in urls)

9. [DONE] Automatically generate preloads from fields data.
