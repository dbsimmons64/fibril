1. [DONE] Do we really need to specify layout - should we just use what is in the library?
2. [DONE] Getting data for a field (in the index view) needs to cater for 4 scenarios:
    1. A simple atom e.g. :name, :date_of_birth
    2. A list [:owner, :name] generally used for associations
    3. A map with a key of name: the value of which is an atom
    4. A map with a key of name: the value of which is a list

3. [TODO] Allow prefix for resource configuration to be changed via a config option.
